      "Applying to Valpo\n",
      "Does Valpo have an application fee?\n",
      "No, Valparaiso University’s application is free to submit.\n",
      "Is it best to apply to Valparaiso University through the Common App or on valpo.edu/apply?\n",
      "It’s up to you! You submit the same information through both so one is not better than the other. We are happy to connect with students interested in the Valpo experience no matter how you choose to apply!\n",
      "Does Valpo require SAT or ACT test scores when applying?\n",
      "Students are able to apply test optional, meaning SAT or ACT test scores are not required and not reporting test scores won’t hinder your application or financial aid award in any way. You may choose to submit test scores if you feel they help represent you as a student.\n",
      "Does Valpo have an early action decision?\n",
      "No, we do not have an early action decision. We have rolling admissions throughout the year. However, applying as early as possible after our application opens is recommended to have the greatest number of scholarship opportunities.\n",
      "How will you view my application if my grades or activities have been disrupted in the pandemic?\n",
      "Canceled opportunities will not affect your admission into Valparaiso University. We take a holistic approach to reviewing applicants to Valparaiso University and consider the many facets of you when reviewing your application: your strength of classes in high school, the trend in your grades, your personal essay, what kind of activities you have been involved in, and your test scores if you choose to submit them. The biggest question is: “Can this person be successful at Valpo?”  Students enroll at Valpo with a wide variety of GPAs, test scores, essays, and extra-curricular involvements.\n",
      "Does Valpo accept dual credit and AP scores?\n",
      "Valpo accepts transfer or “dual” credits. The general rule of thumb is that (a) as long as you took the classes at an accredited school; (b) they were academic courses of at least 100-level; and (c) you received a “C” grade or better, they will typically transfer. We also accept AP tests; simply send a copy of your official score report sent to us. We require different minimum scores for different AP subjects, typically a score of 4 to receive credit from Valpo . Contact your admission counselor for the specific scores needed.\n",
      "How do I access my student portal?\n",
      "You can access your student portal\n",
      "here\n",
      ". You will log in using the email address and password you created when you applied. If you forgot your email address and password, contact your admission counselor so that they can reset your account. You will have to create a new password.\n",
      "If you applied using the Common Application, you will receive an email after we receive your application with instructions to create your admission portal.\n",
      "How will I know if my application materials have been received?\n",
      "After you submit your application, your admission portal will have a checklist of materials that we need in order to review your application. A green checkmark will appear next to an item when we have received it. You can also contact your admission counselor if you have questions.\n",
      "Can I add awards/accolades/information to my application after it’s been submitted?\n",
      "Yes! You can email your admission counselor to update your application information. Anything that you send before you receive an admission decision will be used when considering your application for admission.\n",
      "When will I receive a decision regarding my application?\n",
      "After your application is complete, you will typically find out your status about 4-6 weeks later.  We accept applications at any time on a rolling basis. A complete application typically includes the completed and signed application form, personal statement or essay, standardized test scores if you choose to submit them, and a high school or college transcript. We cannot process your application without all components.\n",
      "Who can I contact for help with Valpo admissions questions?\n",
      "If this is your first time connecting with us, contact us in the Office of Undergraduate Admission by email at undergrad.admission@valpo.edu or by phone at 219.464.5011 and we will connect you with an available counselor or staff member.\n",
      "If you’ve already connected with your admission counselor,\n",

      ".  Our school code is 001842.\n",
      "What is the difference between the direct subsidized loan and direct unsubsidized loan?\n",
      "The federal direct subsidized loan is based on demonstrated need as determined by the results of your FAFSA. The federal government pays the interest for direct subsidized loans while the student is in college or while the loan is in deferment. Interest begins accruing for direct unsubsidized loans as soon as the loan is taken out\n",

      "How do you award transfer credits?\n",
      "Transfer credit is awarded on a course-by-course basis:\n",
      "Most university, college, or community college courses that are equivalent to corresponding Valpo courses are applied toward the general education requirement or as an elective credit.\n",
      "Courses in a student’s major may fulfill major requirements upon approval of the appropriate college dean or department chair.\n",
      "If transferring from a quarter system, three quarter hours usually equal two semester hours of credit. Courses comparable to those offered at Valparaiso University will be accepted for transfer with minimum grades of C-minus. Grades are not transferable; only credits transfer. Nursing prerequisite courses must have a grade of C or better to be considered.\n",
      "Credits earned more than 15 years ago are accepted toward graduation requirements on a provisional basis; students must then complete 30 semester hours at Valpo with a minimum 2.0 grade-point average or better.\n",
      "Where is your transfer database?\n",
      "You may be able to look up transfer equivalencies for your previous course work. Our goal is to list all possible transfer credits from other higher education institutions and the database is being updated daily.\n",

      "Choose the college or university you are currently attending or have attended in the past.\n",
      "Choose the subject area you are looking for, or “ALL SUBJECTS.”\n",
      "On the left side, you will see the course as it is titled at your current institution. The left is the name of the Valpo course that it is equal to or it is listed as UND, which means it is undistributed credit and your advisor will decide how to place that course in your degree audit.\n",
      "If you don’t see your courses or college listed, don’t worry – it may still be eligible for transfer credit. This is a database in progress and we are still working on uploading all transfer equivalencies.\n",
      "What is the maximum amount of credits that you will accept?\n",
      "Maximum number of advanced standing credits that can transfer:\n",

      "We don’t require Proof of Financial Support until after a student has been accepted and want their I-20 form sent to them.\n",
      "What is Proof of Financial Support?\n",
      "It is a requirement to issue an I-20 and proof that you have funds to support yourself for one year of education after scholarships. The proof covers spending money, travel, housing, food, health insurance, fees and tuition. At no time will you be required to give us the full amount of money.\n",
      "Does Valpo accept dual credit and AP, IB, and A levels scores?\n",

      "How will you view my application if my grades or activities have been disrupted in the pandemic?\n",
      "Canceled opportunities will not affect your admission into Valparaiso University. We take a holistic approach to reviewing applicants to Valparaiso University and consider the many facets of you when reviewing your application: your strength of classes in high school, the trend in your grades, your personal essay, what kind of activities you have been involved in, and your test scores if you choose to submit them. The biggest question is: “Can this person be successful at Valpo?”  Students enroll at Valpo with a wide variety of GPAs, test scores, essays, and extra-curricular involvements.\n",
      "Do you award scholarships for international students?\n",
      "Absolutely. 98% of international students receive scholarships. International students are eligible for merit-based scholarships based on holistic review of your application and range from $5,000-$30,000.\n",
      "We only offer merit-based scholarships and do not have need-based scholarships for international students.\n",
